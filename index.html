<p>I am a climate change and development policy researcher. I have Master in Applied International Development from the University of Reading, UK. Prior to this I led a community movement to save the Arpa River in Bilaspur, victim of illicit dumping by local industries and hospitals. I have also worked with students from displaced and vulnerable communities through my work with government schools and children&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>I have got a gold medal in Rural Technology and French from Central University of Chhattisgarh. During that period I worked closely with rural communities of Chhattisgarh to help them adopt to challanges faced by climate change. I have led training programs in alternate sources of income such as sericulture, mushroom farming etc. I offer consulting and policy research< services which include: reviewing and evaluating policies, determine the benefits and drawbacks of existing policies
proposing suggestions to improve the effects of policies, editing and amending policy drafts as required, data collection and producing reports on the qualitative and quantitative analysis etc./p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy singing and playing violin. I am also an avid reader and a novice cook.
